# Requirements

## Minimal functional requirements:

+ One player should always play randomly, the other should always choose rock. No user interaction should be required (i.e. no reading from stdin and waiting for a user interaction).

+ The application should play 100 rounds of the game.

+ The application should evaluate the game logic, i.e. the result (e.g. WIN, DRAW, LOSE) of two actions (e.g. ROCK, PAPER, SCISSOR) competing against each other.

+ The application should calculate at least the number of wins for each player and the number of draws.



## Technical requirements:

+ Language: Kotlin, tests in a language and with a framework of your choice

+ Approach: ideally "test-drivenâ€œ

+ Build files (e.g. for Gradle or Maven) should be included in the project
